# Probabilistic Mission Design

This repository implements Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis).
ProMis enables users to formalize their knowledge of local rules, such as traffic regulations, to constrain an agent's actions and movements. 
To achieve this, we employ probabilistic first-order logic, a mathematical framework that combines formal reasoning with probabilistic inference.
This provides a weighted belief whether the encoded rules are satisfied for a state or action. 

Using ProMis, we pave the way towards Constitutional Agents. 
Such agents can give reasons for their actions and act in a principled fashion even under uncertainty. 
To this end, ProMis provides high-level, easy-to-understand, and adaptable control over the navigation process, for example, to seamlessly integrate local laws, operator requirements, and environmental uncertainties into logical and spatial constraints. 

Using ProMis, scalar fields of the probability of adhering to the agent's constitution are obtained across its state space.
These can then be utilized for tasks such as path planning, automated clearance granting, explaining the impact of, and optimizing mission parameters.
For instance, the following shows ProMis being applied in a diverse set of scenarios, with a high probability of satisfying all flight restrictions being shown in blue, a low probability being shown in red, and unsuitable spaces being transparent.
